STEPS -->
Import the package. We are using the system’s time. To retrieve the system’s time, import strftime function.
Define a window screen. You can’t resize the window screen. After that, set a title for the window screen. It’s optional. Mine is "CLOCK".
Define the time function. The format would be H: M: S.
Style the clock widget to make it attractive. The font size of the clock string is set to 80. The foreground color is set to “cyan” and background to "Black".
Add a mainloop function at the end.
